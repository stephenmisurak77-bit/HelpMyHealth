# Help My Health
 
An AI-assisted health triage tool that helps you decide:
Self-care • Doctor • Urgent care • Emergency

Not a diagnosis — decision support based on trusted medical sources.

## The Problem
Most people Google symptoms when they feel unwell.

Search results are often:
- alarming
- unreliable
- hard to interpret
- not personalized

This leads to two risks:
1. Ignoring serious symptoms
2. Unnecessary panic and ER visits

## The Solution
Help My Health is a decision-support assistant that helps users determine the appropriate level of care.

The system:
1. Interprets natural language symptoms
2. Pulls guidance from trusted medical sources (NHS, MedlinePlus)
3. Uses research evidence (PubMed)
4. Returns clear next-step advice
